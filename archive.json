The connection between KEMs and how they are used in protocols (or how signatures are used in protocols for that matter) would benefit from more explanation. This is particularly useful and some developers have misunderstood the distinction and are trying to use KEMs \u2018in the raw\u2019 without all the careful constructs that protocols build around them. This leaves such implementations open to various attacks. Explaining this context as one of the essential consideration in your draft could certainly help prevent future attacks.",

      "body": "Dear Kris,\n\nThank you for this draft. I must confess that I don't really understand the intended scope of this document. It is stated as \"for protocol designers and implementers\", which is probably already a bit too wide, as both groups would expect guidance on different aspects. But many parts of the document appear to aim even wider, discussing how organisations should manage the switch to PQC. I think such organisational concerns are already quite well adressed by guidance documents from the likes of NIST, UK-NCSC, BSI and ANSSI; I don't see what IETF, with its mostly *technical* expertise, could add here.\n\nThe current document would probably be better if it focused on the technical aspects of introducing PQC. The document already contains very useful concrete information, such as section 7 (\"Migration pitfalls\"). If we expand the discussion of the issues in section 5 (\"Infrastructure costs\") to the same level of concrete detail, I think it might become a valuable resource for its intended audience.\n\n--  Marc Penninga",

      "body": "Hi Kris,\n\nThank you for writing this draft, I think it covers lots of useful ground.\n\nAbstract: \"It is intended for cryptographic protocol designers within the IETF community, as well as technology developers and implementers responsible for deploying PQC standards.\" - this audience is too broad. The assumed background varies greatly between these target audiences, and also, the latter audience implicitly expects the former to do much of the prep work for them, e.g. decide on hybrid vs. pure, or solve for the \"combinatorial explosion\".\n\n\"whether to begin the migration immediately or adopt a phased timeline\" - most orgs will be doing both \u2013 start immediately but with a phased approach.\n\nSec. 3 assumes that the reader knows some basics, like which algorithms are under threat, what PQC is, and even the notion of PQ/T hybrid. Can we refer the reader to a source for this background?\n\nTypo: because resilience\n\"if a single algorithm fails\" - this requires further explanation because we have never had this strategy before. We should explain that traditional algorithms will be broken by CRQCs, and PQ algorithms are risky because they are relatively new and so have not undergone enough cryptanalysis.\n\n\"importance of PQ/T hybrid KEMs will diminish in time\" - and then we should add the consequence, which is another migration phase, this time to pure PQ.\n\n\"the migration to post-quantum digital signatures is less time-sensitive\" - with the well known exception of very long lived verifiers (IOT devices deployed in the field and accepting software updates).\n\n\"Long-term protection through hybrids may be limited in practice\" - I'm not sure about this assertion. Key rotation is one thing, but if a scheme/algorithm is compromised, you also need to upgrade the software which takes a lot longer than key management timeframes. The following paragraph recommends crypto agility as the better solution, in practice this is less of a panacea because you end up with lightly tested software and infrastructure that could easily fail when the time comes.\n\n\"a comprehensive inventory of cryptographic use\" - nowadays this is basically an inventory of the entire org's software. So I'm wondering is a separate inventory even makes sense. Moreover, if it does, you would have already built it (and the associated organizational processes) for the migration into TLS 1.3.\nBest,\n\n                Yaron",
