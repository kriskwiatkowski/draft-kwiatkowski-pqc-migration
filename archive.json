You mentioned and discussed it in Chapter 5, \"Infrastructure Costs.\" I believe that a flag or trigger message describe in this I-D is absolutely a very useful feature. If you have time, you can read more in my I-Ds, and welcome comments.\n\n",

      "body": "> The current text, however, focuses on KEMs (which are not protocols but algorithms). The connection between KEMs and how they are used in protocols (or how signatures are used in protocols for that matter) would benefit from more explanation. This is particularly useful and some developers have misunderstood the distinction and are trying to use KEMs \u2018in the raw\u2019 without all the careful constructs that protocols build around them. This leaves such implementations open to various attacks. Explaining this context as one of the essential consideration in your draft could certainly help prevent future attacks.",
