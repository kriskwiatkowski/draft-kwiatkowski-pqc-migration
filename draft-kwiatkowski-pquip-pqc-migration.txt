1.  Introduction

   Advances in quantum computing pose a growing threat to systems that
   rely on widely deployed internet security protocols, which use
   cryptographic mechanisms to secure communications, verify
   authenticity, and protect sensitive data at rest and in transit.
   While a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) capable of
   breaking these protections may still be years away, initiating the
   transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) now is essential to
   ensure adequate time for planning and implementation.

2.  Awarness

   Before embarking on the transition to post-quantum cryptography
   (PQC), organizations must first evaluate whether to begin the
   migration immediately or adopt a phased timeline.  This decision
   depends on factors such as the duration required for migration, the
   expected shelf-life of sensitive data, and the projected timeline for
   quantum threats.  Data with long-term confidentiality requirements
   may increase the urgency, as adversaries could collect encrypted
   information today and decrypt it in the future using a
   cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC).  Even in the
   absence of a direct harvest-now-decrypt-later threat, organizations
   must still prepare to protect data integrity and authenticity against
   future quantum-enabled attacks.

   To guide this process, organizations should clearly define their PQC
   migration objectives, starting with an assessment of their risk
   tolerance - how much risk they are willing to accept in safeguarding
   data and assets.  This assessment will shape the choice of PQC
   algorithms, protocols, and implementation paths.  It's important to
   recognize that PQC migration is not a one-off upgrade but a
   continuous effort that requires ongoing threat monitoring, periodic
   reassessments, and adaptability as quantum technology evolves.

3.  Key exchange

   Key exchange is a fundamental component of security protocols that
   allows two entities to securely exchange keys over an insecure
   channel to derive symmetric session keys.

   The development of cryptanalytically relevant quantum computers
   (CRQCs) threatens current systems, necessitating a migration to post-
   quantum cryptography (PQC).  A key concern driving this migration,
   particularly for key exchange, is the "harvest-now-decrypt-later"
   threat.  Adversaries may collect and store sensitive data encrypted
   with keys established using quantum-vulnerable methods today, with
   the intention of decrypting it later once CRQCs are available.  This
   threat specifically impacts the confidentiality of communications,
   which is protected by keys derived during the key exchange process.

   Hybrid key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) are widely recommended
   because resilience that they offer: even if one of the underlying
   algorithms is broken (e.g., the classical or post-quantum scheme),
   the confidentiality of the session remains protected as long as the
   other holds.  This property is essential in practice, since encrypted
   data captured today could be decrypted in the future if a single
   algorithm fails.

4.  Digital signatures

   Digital signatures remain a vital component of cryptographic
   protocols, ensuring authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation.  As
   such, post-quantum digital signature schemes are necessary in a
   future-proof internet infrastructure.  However, the urgency to deploy
   them is relatively lower compared to key encapsulation mechanisms
   (KEMs).

   In practice, most public keys used for signatures are either short-
   lived or revocable.  This allows systems to respond to a break by
   revoking or rotating keys, thus limiting the impact of a broken
   signature scheme.  Additionally, the compromise of a signature scheme
   is expected to be a publicly known event, allowing protocols and
   infrastructure to adapt promptly.  Therefore, while post-quantum
   signature algorithms are essential for long-term security, their
   deployment can follow a more measured timeline.

   TODO: migration strategies, hybrid signatures vs dual signatures,
   etc.

4.1.  Hybrid digital signatures

   Hybrid digital signatures combine classical and post-quantum
   signature schemes to provide resilience against future quantum
   attacks.  However, their practical benefits are limited, and they
   introduce significant complexity and potential security pitfalls.

   Although hybrid digital signatures can offer resilience by combining
   classical and post-quantum schemes, they introduce significant
   implementation complexity and potential pitfalls.  For instance, key
   reuse and domain separation issues can lead to downgrade attacks if
   not carefully managed.  The added size and verification costs also
   strain constrained environments.

   Hybrid digital signatures, provide limited real-world benefit and can
   introduce security pitfalls: * If one of the schemes fails, forged
   signatures are only exploitable while the associated public key
   remains trusted. * Most systems are designed to revoke or rotate keys
   upon compromise, rendering long-term hybrid signature protection less
   relevant. * Risks such as key reuse (e.g., using the same key for
   hybrid and non-hybrid modes) require careful domain separation, which
   can be error-prone. * The combinatorial explosion of hybrid
   combinations increases implementation and interoperability
   complexity.  Protocols should instead focus on algorithm agility,
   embedding algorithm identifiers in keys, and enabling fast key
   rollover.  Protocol designers are encouraged to prepare for signature
   migration, but widespread deployment can be aligned with broader
   infrastructure readiness and the availability of standardized and
   efficient PQC signature schemes.

5.  FIPS

   Current FIPS 140-3 validation poses a challenge for rapid adoption of
   PQC.  Many post-quantum algorithms are not yet approved within FIPS-
   validated modules, making hybrid deployments difficult in regulated
   environments.

   While the sources discuss the FIPS standards for the pure PQC
   algorithms used within hybrid constructions, they do not explicitly
   state that hybrid signature schemes or formats themselves are
   approved by CMVP validation.  The FIPS standards (204, 205) define
   the individual signature algorithms, which can then be used as
   components in a hybrid scheme.

   Migration plans must align with CMVP guidance and anticipate
   validation pathways for post-quantum schemes.

   TODO: Mention SP800-56C and lack of standardization for hybrid
   signatures.

6.  Infrastructure costs

   Migrating to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) necessitates potentially
   significant updates to an organization's cryptographic
   infrastructure.  The process requires careful planning and resource
   allocation to address various financial and operational costs.

   A key aspect of PQC migration involves identifying and budgeting for
   discovery initiatives, which aim to understand the organization's
   cryptographic assets and their PQC relevancy.  This includes building
   a comprehensive inventory of cryptographic use and associated assets.
   The process of inventorying may require specific tools and methods,
   which also factor into the initial costs.

   A major cost driver is determining whether PQC updates can be
   implemented through software updates or will necessitate more
   expensive hardware replacements or upgrades.  Engaging with system
   vendors is crucial to confirm migration needs, inquire about the cost
   of new PQC solutions, and understand the anticipated business impact
   of implementation efforts.  For custom or niche systems,
   organizations may need to budget for the cost of developing internal
   PQC-compliant solutions.

   Specific infrastructure components and systems require updates,
   leading to associated costs:

   *  Network Protocols and Systems: Protocols like TLS, SSH, and QUIC,
      widely used in telecom networks and general IT infrastructure,
      need to integrate PQC for key exchange and authentication.  While
      the computational performance impact of PQC Key Encapsulation
      Mechanisms (KEMs) like ML-KEM on handshake speed is often minimal
      or even faster compared to traditional methods, the size of PQC
      artifacts is much larger, which can lead to increased bandwidth
      usage and potential delays.

   *  Certificate Size Impact: Larger certificate sizes, especially for
      PQC signature algorithms like ML-DSA, can impact network
      performance.  This is due to interaction with network parameters
      like the amplification window, congestion control, and initial
      round-trip time estimates, potentially causing extra round trips
      and delays.  While tweaking these parameters can alleviate some
      issues, it involves trade-offs, which relate to operational
      network costs (bandwidth, latency).

   *  Message Processing: The way PQC signature algorithms process
      messages (often processing the whole message internally) differs
      from the traditional "digest-then-sign" approach.  For very large
      messages, this can impact performance, especially when streaming
      data to constrained signing entities like HSMs via APIs like
      PKCS#11 . While digesting before signing can improve performance
      for large messages , it reintroduces collision risk and adds
      complexity.  Implementing and managing these different processing
      methods across various systems can add to development and
      operational costs.

   *  Public Key Infrastructure (PKI): The PKI supporting systems needs
      to be updated to handle PQC keys and certificates.  This involves
      changes to Certificate Authorities (CAs), certificate formats
      (e.g., X.509), and related processes.  Various hybrid certificate
      formats are being explored to facilitate the transition, each with
      different complexity and potential overhead.  The deployment of
      new Trust Anchors can also be a time-consuming and costly process.

   *  Constrained Devices: Devices with long operational lifetimes in
      environments like industrial control systems, vehicles,
      satellites, smart meters, and smart cards present unique
      challenges and potential costs.  Upgrading cryptographic
      capabilities on such devices may be difficult or even impossible
      due to resource constraints, physical location, or immutability
      features, potentially requiring expensive field updates or device
      replacement.

   *  Hybrid Implementations: While motivated by security concerns
      during the transition period, hybrid signature strategies can
      introduce increased complexity and potential overhead in terms of
      data size.  The use of hybrids also implies a potential future
      migration when one or both constituent algorithms become obsolete,
      deferring some costs rather than eliminating them.  The
      combinatorial explosion of combining various classical and PQC
      schemes adds complexity to implementation and testing.

   Beyond direct hardware and software costs, continuous monitoring and
   evaluation are also necessary to track migration progress and adapt
   to evolving quantum capabilities, requiring ongoing resource
   commitment.

   TODO: How to monitor?

   Adopting principles like cryptographic agility is highlighted as a
   way to manage costs in the long term by designing systems that can
   undergo multiple cryptographic transitions without major
   architectural changes, thereby reducing the cost of future updates.
   However, achieving true agility requires effort in standardization
   and implementation to support simultaneous use or dynamic negotiation
   of algorithms.

7.  Anti-patterns

   Several practices should be avoided during PQC migration:

   *  Key reuse across modes: Using the same keypair for hybrid and non-
      hybrid signatures risks downgrade attacks.

   *  Dynamic algorithm negotiation: Negotiating algorithm types at
      runtime (e.g., in TLS) can allow downgrade or confusion attacks.
      Algorithm identifiers should be part of the public key structure.

   *  Excessive hybridization: Supporting too many hybrid combinations
      introduces combinatorial complexity and compatibility issues.

   *  Ignoring key lifecycle: Systems that do not account for key
      expiration and revocation are particularly vulnerable in post-
      quantum scenarios.

   Robust protocol design, infrastructure readiness, and clear
   separation of cryptographic roles are essential to avoid these anti-
   patterns.
