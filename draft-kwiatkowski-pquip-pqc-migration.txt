             Guidance for migration to Post-Quantum schemes
              draft-kwiatkowski-pquip-pqc-migration-latest

Abstract

   This document provides guidance for the migration to post-quantum
   cryptography (PQC) in internet protocols.  It outlines the challenges
   and considerations that protocol designers and implementers should
   take into account when transitioning from classical cryptographic
   algorithms to PQC algorithms, which are designed to be secure against
   quantum computer attacks.

   It is intended for cryptographic protocol designers within the IETF
   community, as well as technology developers and implementers
   responsible for deploying PQC standards.

1.  Introduction

   Advances in quantum computing pose a growing threat to systems that
   rely on widely deployed internet security protocols, which use
   cryptographic mechanisms to secure communications, verify
   authenticity, and protect sensitive data at rest and in transit.
   While a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) capable of
   breaking these protections may still be years away, initiating the
   transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) now is essential to
   ensure adequate time for planning and implementation.
